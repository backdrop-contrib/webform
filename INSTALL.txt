Requirements
------------

Drupal CVS HEAD


Installation
------------

1. Create the SQL tables. This depends a little on your system, but the most
   common method is:
     mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < webform.mysql

2. Copy the webform.module to the Drupal modules/ directory.

3. Enable the module in the admin interface.

4. (Optional) Edit the settings under "admin" -> "settings" -> "webform"

Upgrading from previous version
-------------------------------

1. Copy the new webform.module to the Drupal modules/ directory.

2. Go to "admin" -> "settings" ->  "webform" and select the upgrade link.

The .POT file
-------------
The .POT file is a template file for translating the module into non-english languages.
If you are not interested in helping with translation you can safely remove this file 
(and the po directory).
